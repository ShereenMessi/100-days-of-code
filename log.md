### Day 1: November 25, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've made my First React Native App and tested it on my Android mobile.

### Day 2: November 26, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I played around some basic components like text and image.

**Thoughts** I kinda missed Web development.
### Day 3: November 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I learned about more views in react-native (Button, ScrollView and ListView) and how to handle Touching events .
